# exporter.py
# Builds a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb JSON) from a session's code history.
# Pure logic — no I/O, no side effects.
# Supports: PRD #7 (Export)
# Key deps: none (builds a plain dict, no nbformat library)
#
# Each code_history entry becomes a markdown cell (explanation) followed by
# a code cell (generated code). The notebook also includes a header cell with
# library imports and a data-loading cell that reads the uploaded file.
#
# Architecture ref: "exporter.py" in planning/architecture.md
